# Summary

gwArsenicR is an R package \[@R-base\] that provides a streamlined workflow for epidemiologists and public health researchers to estimate arsenic exposure from private and public well water and to assess its association with various health outcomes. The package implements a sophisticated statistical approach that combines geospatial arsenic prediction models with a multiple imputation framework to account for exposure uncertainty. The core functionality integrates predicted arsenic concentration probabilities from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) models for private wells with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data for public water systems. It then uses a weighting scheme based on the proportion of the population served by each water source to create a unified, county-level exposure probability distribution. By encapsulating these complex methodologies into a single, user-friendly function, gwArsenicR makes this type of analysis more accessible, reproducible, and standardized.

# Statement of Need

Chronic exposure to arsenic in drinking water is a significant public health problem, linked to a range of adverse health outcomes. Assessing this risk is challenging, particularly for the estimated 40 million Americans who rely on unregulated private wells \[@DeSimone-2015\]. Foundational studies by @Bulka-2022 and @Lombard-2021 have established robust methodologies for this purpose, but their implementation requires specialized expertise in data integration, statistical modeling, and computational methods. This presents a significant barrier for many environmental health researchers who may lack the necessary programming skills to replicate or adapt these complex analyses.

gwArsenicR directly addresses this need by packaging the entire analytical pipeline into an easy-to-use R function. It automates the process of:

1. Converting lognormal EPA arsenic data to a multinomial distribution.  
2. Combining USGS and EPA models based on population-use weights.  
3. Performing multiple imputation to manage exposure uncertainty.  
4. Fitting mixed-effects regression models to health data.  
5. Pooling results according to Rubin's Rules \[@Rubin-1987\].

By providing this accessible tool, gwArsenicR lowers the barrier to entry for conducting high-quality research on the health impacts of groundwater contaminants, promoting reproducibility and wider application of these state-of-the-art methods in environmental epidemiology.

# Design and Implementation

## Software Architecture

gwArsenicR follows a modular design philosophy centered around the main exported function `perform_sensitivity_analysis()`, which orchestrates the complete analytical workflow. The package architecture consists of four main modules:

* **Data Loading Module** (`data-loading.R`): Handles import and preprocessing of USGS probability data, EPA lognormal parameters, and health outcome datasets with comprehensive input validation.
* **Imputation Module** (`imputation.R`): Implements multiple imputation for arsenic exposure levels and optional MICE \[@mice-2011\] imputation for missing covariates.
* **Regression Module** (`regression.R`): Fits linear mixed-effects models using lme4 \[@lme4-2015\] and pools results according to Rubin's Rules using Amelia \[@Amelia-2011\].
* **Utilities Module** (`utils.R`): Provides data formatting, validation, and helper functions.

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Flexible Data Integration**: The package accommodates the different probability structures of USGS and EPA data by converting EPA lognormal parameters to multinomial probabilities compatible with USGS discrete probability categories. Population-weighted averaging creates unified exposure probability distributions that reflect the actual water source usage patterns in each geographic area.

**Robust Multiple Imputation**: gwArsenicR implements a two-stage imputation strategy. First, it performs probabilistic assignment of arsenic exposure categories based on the integrated probability distributions. Second, it optionally implements MICE \[@mice-2011\] for missing demographic and health covariates, ensuring that all sources of uncertainty are properly propagated through the analysis.

**Hierarchical Modeling**: The package leverages lme4 \[@lme4-2015\] to fit linear mixed-effects models that account for the hierarchical structure typical of population health data (e.g., individuals nested within counties, counties within states). This approach provides more accurate standard errors and better accounts for geographic clustering.

**Statistical Rigor**: Results from multiple imputed datasets are pooled using Rubin's Rules \[@Rubin-1987\], which properly combines point estimates and accounts for both within-imputation and between-imputation variance. This ensures that confidence intervals and p-values correctly reflect the uncertainty introduced by the imputation process.

**Performance Optimization**: The package uses data.table \[@data.table-2025\] for efficient handling of large datasets and implements vectorized operations for probability calculations, making it practical for national-scale epidemiological studies.

**Quality Assurance**: gwArsenicR includes comprehensive testing with >95% code coverage, automated continuous integration across multiple R versions and operating systems, and extensive input validation to prevent common user errors.


# **Research Enabled by gwArsenicR**

By simplifying a complex analytical workflow, gwArsenicR can accelerate and broaden the scope of research in environmental health. The package enables researchers to:

* **Rapidly Test Hypotheses**: Easily investigate the health effects of arsenic exposure on a wide range of outcomes, such as birth weight, gestational age, cancer incidence, or cardiovascular disease, using large, nationally representative datasets.  
* **Conduct Subgroup Analyses**: Modify the regression formula to explore whether associations differ across specific subpopulations (e.g., by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or geographic region), which can help identify vulnerable groups.  
* **Inform Public Health Policy**: Generate robust evidence that can inform policy decisions, such as establishing state-level guidelines for private well testing or targeting public health interventions in high-risk areas.  
* **Serve as a Methodological Template**: The package's framework can be adapted to study other environmental contaminants where exposure data is uncertain and requires integration from multiple sources.

Ultimately, gwArsenicR empowers a wider research community to contribute to our understanding of the health risks posed by groundwater contaminants, fostering more timely and impactful science.
